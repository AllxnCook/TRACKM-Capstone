### TRACKM

TRACKM was built to relieve the stress of keeping time for a bus operator. We as operators know how bad it is filling out time sheets and inspection sheets for equipment we use daily. I wanted to solve that with this application.

Built with React.js, TRACKM allows users to track their times in a card format and has a select option for if they have completed their mandatory paperwork for that trip. Once that trip is over, the user can see all of their past trips in a convenient view to help them keep track of their time spent driving the bus.
